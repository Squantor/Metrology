# Wheatstone bridge and Hamon divider
This board contains some bits to implement a wheatstone/comparison bridge, and its calibration components. Next to that there is some space for a Hamon divider, that can be calibrated with the wheatstone bridge.
Schematic is based on ideas from Conrad Hoffman and his [miniature metrology lab series](http://conradhoffman.com/mini_metro_lab.html). The bridge is based on the comparison bridge for KVD resistor selection on [this page](http://conradhoffman.com/MML%20files/3_kvd_p3.jpg), the hamon divider are based on this [article by Conrad Hoffman](http://conradhoffman.com/HamonResistor.html) and this [excellent topic](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/anyone-else-built-a-hamon-divider/) on the EEVBLOG forums.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
