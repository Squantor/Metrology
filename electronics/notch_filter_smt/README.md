# Notch filter SMT version
Single frequency notch filter, used for verifying oscillator purity. The filter is centered around the oscillator fundamental frequency but passes most of the harmonics. An additional low noise/high gain amplifier can then amplify these harmonics and this way you can determine oscillator purity. This is the SMT version using SOIC opamp and SMT capacitors.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Modify components to SMT versions
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* OPA209 SOIC opamp
