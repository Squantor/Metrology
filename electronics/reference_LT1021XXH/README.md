# LT1021 reference, TO can
Voltage reference based around the [LT1021](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/1021fc.pdf) in TO can format. This hermetic reference has better properties then the PDIP version but is hard to find and quite pricey.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
