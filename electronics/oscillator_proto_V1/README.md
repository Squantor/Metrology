# Prototype oscillator module Dual opamp with standard level adjust
This is a prototyping board layout for a dual opamp wien bridge oscillator where both opamps are in one package. The level adjust feedback is a standard rectification integrator vactrol combination that is available in many designs.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Build on protoboard
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* For the oscillator use a high quality low noise opamp like LME4920 series or NE5532
* For feedback use TL081 opamps
