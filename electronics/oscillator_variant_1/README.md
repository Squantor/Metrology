# Wien bridge oscillator module
This is a single dual opamp wien bridge oscillator. Gain control is done via a rectification amplifier and integrator driving a vactrol in the inverting amplifier of the oscillator. This oscillator is more or less the design done by [Vojtěch Janásek](http://www.janascard.cz/PDF/An%20ultra%20low%20distortion%20oscillator%20with%20THD%20below%20-140%20dB.pdf) from [janascard](http://www.janascard.cz/).
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* PCB layout
* Build on protoboard
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* For the oscillator use a high quality low noise opamp like LME4920 series or NE5532
* For feedback use TL081 opamps
* For the wien bridge capacitors either Polypropylene or ceramic NP0 will suffice.
