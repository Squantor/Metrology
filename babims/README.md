# BABIMS
Bart Bilos Measurement System (BABIMS) is a modular measurement system developed by me (Bart Bilos).
They fulfill a need that I often encounter by measuring various things 
and making experimental setups. I have some equipment but I would also like
some long term solutions. Initially I will create some prototyping platform
to explore the form factor before I commit to any real cards. 
## Cards
Currently 3 cards and one mainboard planned.
### mainboard
Just 4 slots for connectors and one big pinheader and molex connector for
connections externally. some prototyping area will be sprinkled everywhere.
### Prototyping card
Basically contains all the electrical connections like the bus and the front 
connector but with a lot of prototyping area. The ADC/DAC boards are going
to be prototyped on this form factor. 
# TODO
* Lots!
